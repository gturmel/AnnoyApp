var myApp = angular.module("myApp", ['ngRoute']);

// myApp.config(function($routeProvider){
//    $routeProvider
//       .when('/', {
//          templateUrl: ''
//       })
// })

//I'm going to probably not need routing for this app - I'm just going to pull in partials, but does that need a routing? I don't think so. I think I'll be able to switch around based on click using ng-click, ng-show, ng-hide, and maybe some other things along those lines.
