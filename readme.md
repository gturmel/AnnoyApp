# Read Me!

## This is my rough Angular JS app

I am going to do my best here to create a loose Appointments app. The dream is to have it so functional it's almost annoying. Modals showing up, things hiding and showing, having to navigate around quite a bit. I want all of these distracting things to happen in Angular, to kinda practice what I'm learning with Angular and get more familiar with it.

## Modules:

I should only really need one. All the controllers can branch off of that. I can config it up later to include routing. For now, I'm going to let it lie.

## Controllers:

I'll want a controller for each distinct piece of code.

1. A controller for holding my initial array of information. I should also think about what functionality I want to include in this one.

2. A controller for adding items to the To-do list.

3. A controller for removing items from the To do list.

4. Hmmmm....lets think about this.

## HTML:

As of now, I'm going to put off routing until later. I can make this a true one page app, and chop it up later. Maybe using directives? Element directives will let us pull the things in that we want, and that seems like a good exercise.

## CSS:

Lets just get some stuff styled. Should be fairly straightforward.

### Hi K and J!

Ok, so I just saw that I needed a ReadMe for this, and I haven't started the .md file for Etsy, so I'm rushing through this just a bit. Sorry about this. Battles that I fought for this one include:

$scope. getting there. Dim bulb territory.
Filters. I want to try and filter/sanitize my time/date inputs. Maybe using those jQuery plugins.
AddTodo. Getting that up and running was weird. I cribbed heavily from the Code School tutorial here.

All told, I feel better about Angular now than when I walked in Monday Morning. Progress! Keep being awesome you two!
